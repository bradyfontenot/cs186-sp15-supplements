## Section 9

Topics: Query Optimization

I made a mistake this week and accidentally used the wrong discussion
worksheet. Basically, the ones that I printed were based on the Spring 2014
questions, while the ones that the other GSIs used were based on the Fall 2013
questions (which are actually easier). I am including everything below, in case
you want additional practice, or if you want to see the answers.
